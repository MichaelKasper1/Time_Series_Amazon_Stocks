# Time_Series_Amazon_Stocks

This project focuses on time series forecasting. 

In the last few decades, there's been an explosive increase in the average person's interest in the stock market. This makes stock value prediction an interesting and popular problem to explore. This dataset consists of monthly average stock closing prices of Amazon over a period of 12 years from 2006 to 2017. My goal is to build a time series model using the AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA models in order to forecast the stock closing price of Amazon.
